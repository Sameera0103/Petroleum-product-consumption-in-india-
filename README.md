Before running the code, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

-Python (version 3.6 or higher)
-Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for interactive analysis)

You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Required libraries 
-Pandas 
-Numpy 
-Seaborn
-Matplotlib

## Installation
1.Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sameera0103/petroleum-consumption-analysis.git
```
2.Change into the project directory:
```bash
cd petroleum-consumption-analysis
```
## Data
The analysis uses historical petroleum consumption data for India. Ensure you have the dataset available in the data directory before running the code. You can obtain the dataset from below

# Data Source:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tahzeer/consumption-of-petroleum-products-in-india).

## Usage
1.Open the Jupyter Notebook (recommended) or run the Python script directly.
```bash
jupyter notebook petroleum_consumption_analysis.ipynb
```
or
```bash
python petroleum_consumption_analysis.py
```
Follow the instructions in the notebook or script to execute the analysis.
1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-Sameera0103/AI_Phase1.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd petroleum-consumption-analysis
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the required Python libraries as mentioned in the "Dependencies" section.

4. **Data Preparation:**

   Place your market basket transaction data in the `data` folder. The data should be in a CSV format, with columns like `Month` and `year`.

5. **Configure Parameters:**

   Open the `config.py` file and set the required parameters, such as support and confidence thresholds for association rule mining.

6. **Run the Code:**

   Execute the main script to analyze the market basket data.

   ```bash
   python petroleum product consumption.py
   ```

   The script will perform data preprocessing, association rule mining, and generate insights.

7. **View Results:**

   The results and visualizations will be saved in the `output` folder. You can explore them to gain insights into market basket data.


## Results
After running the code, you will get visualizations and insights into petroleum product consumption trends in India. The results will be displayed in the output of the Jupyter Notebook or in the console if you run the Python script.
